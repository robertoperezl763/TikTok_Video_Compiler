1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,995
The Memory Killer.

2
00:00:00,995 --> 00:00:01,990
In the Dead

3
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,985
of Night, a

4
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:03,981
young filmmaker received

5
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:04,976
a mysterious package

6
00:00:04,976 --> 00:00:05,971
with a note

7
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:06,967
reading, Make Me

8
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:07,962
Famous. Included was

9
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:08,957
an old 8mm

10
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:09,953
camera and a

11
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:10,948
reel of film

12
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:11,943
with a single

13
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:12,939
frame. A photo

14
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:13,934
of her childhood

15
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:14,929
best friend, Emily,

16
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:15,925
whose disappearance had

17
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:16,920
haunted her for

18
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,915
years. As she

19
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:18,911
watched the documentary

20
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:19,906
she had been

21
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:20,901
working on for

22
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:21,897
years, she noticed

23
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:22,892
strange alterations. Emily

24
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:23,887
was still alive,

25
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:24,883
but her eyes

26
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:25,878
seemed to plead

27
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:26,873
for help. Suddenly,

28
00:00:26,873 --> 00:00:27,869
the camera jammed

29
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:28,864
and the screen

30
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:29,859
went black.

31
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,004
When she finally

32
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,008
gathered the courage

33
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,012
to rewind the

34
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:34,016
film, Emily's smiling

35
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:35,020
face now read,

36
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,300
Goodbye, Forever.
