1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,893
The cell phone

2
00:00:00,893 --> 00:00:01,786
charger, I stumbled

3
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:02,679
upon an old

4
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:03,573
abandoned apartment complex

5
00:00:03,573 --> 00:00:04,466
while exploring the

6
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:05,359
woods.

7
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,796
As I ventured

8
00:00:06,796 --> 00:00:07,512
in, I noticed

9
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:08,228
an eerie glow

10
00:00:08,228 --> 00:00:08,944
emanating from the

11
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:09,660
basement.

12
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,325
Curiosity got the

13
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:12,130
better of me,

14
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,935
and I descended

15
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:13,740
into darkness.

16
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,496
Rusty pipes scratched

17
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:16,372
beneath my feet,

18
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:17,248
accompanied by menacing

19
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:18,124
whispers on the

20
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:19,000
wind.

21
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,756
Suddenly, a sickly

22
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:21,732
bright light flickered,

23
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:22,708
revealing a single,

24
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:23,684
ancient cell phone

25
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:24,660
charger

26
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,672
atop a ratty

27
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:26,684
mattress. A single

28
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:27,696
cord, severed and

29
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:28,708
twisted by unknown

30
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,720
hands,

31
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,040
ended beside an

32
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,080
antique rotary phone.

33
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,120
Gripping the receiver,

34
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,160
I heard the

35
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,200
soft whisper,

36
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,256
Hello, hello, I

37
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:37,312
slammed the phone

38
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:38,368
down, witnessing its

39
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:39,424
twisted chord begin

40
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,480
to twitch,

41
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,466
plugging itself back

42
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,453
into the charger.

43
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:43,440
When I exited,

44
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,426
my footage showed

45
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:45,413
only static, and

46
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:46,400
the caption,

47
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,840
Ring. Ring.
