1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,996
The echo of

2
00:00:00,996 --> 00:00:01,993
Blackwater Creek, overrun

3
00:00:01,993 --> 00:00:02,990
with Ivy, the

4
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,986
old bridge creaked

5
00:00:03,986 --> 00:00:04,983
in the dying

6
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:05,980
light of day.

7
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,976
Local legend whispered

8
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:07,973
that anyone who

9
00:00:07,973 --> 00:00:08,970
ventured across would

10
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,966
hear the whispers

11
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:10,963
of Blackwater Creek's

12
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:11,960
victims.

13
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,872
Rachel had always

14
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:14,785
been skeptical, but

15
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:15,697
as she stepped

16
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:16,610
onto the rickety

17
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,522
boards, the wind

18
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:18,435
died, and the

19
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,347
only sound was

20
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:20,260
a faint singing.

21
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,331
It began with

22
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:23,602
a single phrase,

23
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:24,874
don't come back.

24
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:26,145
Then, a name,

25
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:27,417
Elizabeth. The words

26
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:28,688
grew closer, sweeter,

27
00:00:28,688 --> 00:00:29,960
and more menacing.

28
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,064
until one phrase

29
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,128
cut through the

30
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,192
fog. You're coming

31
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,256
next. Rachel turned

32
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:35,320
back, but the

33
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,384
creek's darkness had

34
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:37,448
already consumed the

35
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:38,512
bridge, waiting for

36
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:39,576
its next unwary

37
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:40,640
visitor.
