1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,855
The last snowfall,

2
00:00:00,855 --> 00:00:01,710
as the last

3
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,565
snowfall of the

4
00:00:02,565 --> 00:00:03,420
season blanketed the

5
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,275
frozen town, a

6
00:00:04,275 --> 00:00:05,130
sense of unease

7
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,985
crept over its

8
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:06,840
residence.

9
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,448
Among them was

10
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,256
an elderly woman,

11
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:10,064
Emily, who refused

12
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:10,872
to leave her

13
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:11,680
weathered cabin.

14
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,260
The wind howled

15
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,080
like a mournful

16
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,900
sigh outside, as

17
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,720
if aware of

18
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,540
the tragic event

19
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,360
about to unfold.

20
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,128
Suddenly, a faint

21
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:20,076
scratching sounded from

22
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:21,024
the wall, growing

23
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:21,972
louder with each

24
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:22,920
passing moment.

25
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,450
Emily's eyes froze

26
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,240
on the knotted

27
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,030
wood as the

28
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,820
scratching ceased.

29
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,955
Then, the door

30
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:28,630
creaked open, and

31
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,305
she saw the

32
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:29,980
snowy,

33
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,805
gaze of a

34
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:31,610
long forgotten face

35
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,415
etched on the

36
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:33,220
surface, a reminder

37
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,025
that in this

38
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:34,830
fleeting town, no

39
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,635
one truly stayed

40
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,440
buried.
