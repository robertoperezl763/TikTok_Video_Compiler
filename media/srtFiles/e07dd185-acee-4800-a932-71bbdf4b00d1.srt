1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,776
As the darkness

2
00:00:00,776 --> 00:00:01,552
crept in, Emma

3
00:00:01,552 --> 00:00:02,328
struggled to find

4
00:00:02,328 --> 00:00:03,104
her way back

5
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:03,880
to the cabin.

6
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,420
The forest had

7
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,220
transformed into an

8
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,020
eerie abyss, and

9
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,820
the only sound

10
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,620
was the rustling

11
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,420
of leaves beneath

12
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,220
her feet.

13
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,010
Suddenly, a faint

14
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,000
whisper echoed through

15
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,990
the trees. You

16
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,980
shouldn't be here.

17
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,720
As she spun

18
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,720
around, she noticed

19
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,720
the woods had

20
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,720
changed, skewed branches

21
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,720
reached towards her,

22
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
and an unwavering

23
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,720
eye stared back.

24
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,013
The whispers grew

25
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:24,906
louder, the eyes

26
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:25,799
burned brighter, and

27
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:26,693
Emma drifted closer

28
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,586
to the eerie

29
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:28,479
glow.
