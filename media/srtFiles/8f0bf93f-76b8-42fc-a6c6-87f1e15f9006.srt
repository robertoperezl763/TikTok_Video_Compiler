1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,116
The Dollmaker's Revenge.

2
00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:02,232
In the decaying

3
00:00:02,232 --> 00:00:03,348
town of Ravenswood,

4
00:00:03,348 --> 00:00:04,464
a legend whispers

5
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:05,580
of the Dollmaker,

6
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,156
a madman who

7
00:00:07,156 --> 00:00:08,293
created life-like figurines

8
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:09,430
to replace his

9
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,566
dead family. Years

10
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:11,703
later, the townsfolk

11
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:12,840
would hear faint

12
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,863
whispers and giggles

13
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:14,886
echoing from the

14
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:15,909
abandoned workshop. One

15
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:16,933
stormy night, a

16
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,956
group of friends

17
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:18,979
dared to

18
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,256
investigate. As they

19
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:21,532
crept inside, they

20
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:22,808
stumbled upon an

21
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,084
eerie exhibit. Dolls

22
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:25,360
with identical faces,

23
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,540
each adorned with

24
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,400
a faint smile.

25
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,260
Suddenly, the lights

26
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,120
flickered, and the

27
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,980
lights flickered, and

28
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,846
the doll's eyes

29
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:31,693
glowed. The friends

30
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:32,540
tried to run,

31
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,386
but the dolls

32
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:34,233
formed a circle,

33
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:35,080
trapping them.

34
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
The whispers ceased

35
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
as the dollmaker

36
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
reawakened. His creations

37
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
come to claim

38
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
his new family.
