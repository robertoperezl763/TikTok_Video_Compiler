1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,007
The Abandoned Lullaby.

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:02,015
In the Dead

3
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:03,022
of Night, the

4
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:04,030
old record player

5
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,037
in the abandoned

6
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:06,045
nursery world to

7
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:07,052
life, casting an

8
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:08,060
eerie glow.

9
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,036
The warped vinyl

10
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:10,872
groans echoed through

11
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:11,708
the dusty halls,

12
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,544
playing a haunting

13
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,380
melody.

14
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,725
Children's laughter and

15
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:16,830
whispers replied, coming

16
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,935
from nowhere and

17
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,040
everywhere at once.

18
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,893
As the song

19
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:21,886
reached its crescendo,

20
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:22,879
the shadows coalesced

21
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,873
into human silhouettes,

22
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:24,866
dancing in the

23
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:25,859
static.

24
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,620
The player screeched

25
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,700
to silence.

26
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,713
A small door

27
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:30,726
creaked open, revealing

28
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:31,739
a miniature city

29
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:32,753
of toys, where

30
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:33,766
a hidden listener

31
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:34,779
awaited.

32
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,666
The record looped

33
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,533
back to the

34
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:38,400
start, beckoning another

35
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,266
eager ear to

36
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:40,133
join the children's

37
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,000
deadly game.

38
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,660
Will you answer

39
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,180
the call?
